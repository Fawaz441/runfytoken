When you receive the money within a currency, it will not come with any history from the previous users of the currency or the users should have an easy way to disassociate themselves from that history, thus keeping all coins equal.\n                            At the same time, any user will be able to act as an auditor to guarantee the financial integrity of the public ledger without compromising others' privacy. Zompot tackles privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment’s origin.\n                            The protocol will issue Zompot currencies pegged to USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY and the IMF SDR. Over time, more currencies will be added to the list by user voting. The system supports atomic swaps among Zompot currencies at their market exchange rates."
